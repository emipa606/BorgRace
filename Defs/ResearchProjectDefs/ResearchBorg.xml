    <techLevel>Spacer</techLevel>
    <description>With the advent of advanced machining technology, nanites have been adapted to enhance the standard drone body by utilizing available material to construct a comprehensive body glove that maintains the optimal temperature of the body, while thick ablative armor prosthetics have been developed to protect against kinetic and energy weaponry.</description>

    <label>Assimilated power technologies</label>
    <techLevel>Spacer</techLevel>
    <description>The power requirements for maintaining the systems and devices used onboard Borg vessels and outposts is massive - this research provides avenues for the assimilation and adaptation of other humanoid power devices. The infusion of specifically developed nanites results in a massively increased power output. The power station developed from this technology is powered by chemical fuels.</description>

    <label>Cellular nanite prosthetics technology</label>
    <techLevel>Spacer</techLevel>
    <description>The cellular nanites initially injected into a borg host are simple - at least for the borg. Research and expansion of these nanites results in the development of several prosthetics that can be adapted onto any borg frame to increase the output of a drone in any number of specific fields.</description>

    <label>Adapted assimilation technologies</label>
    <techLevel>Spacer</techLevel>
    <description>With progress being made in other fields, one area that requires a more delicate focus is that of assimilation. Standard collective technology is barebones, designed to incorporate any humanoid into the collective. As we are disconnected from the main hive, careful steps must be taken as to not destroy the target. This technology results in the adapted nanite probe, an extremely expensive to create assimilation probe.</description>
